# Virus AmongUs

My project for the PCLP4 University Course. It consists of a website
connected to a Mongo database that stores information about users and files & URLs
that 'may' contain malware.

The website contains :
- A home page with professionally reviews statistics and a lot of other 
completely relevant and useful information
- Login/Register pages that provide access to the next functionalities
- A 'scan' a URL page, that stores your URLs in the database  
- A 'scan' a file page, that does the same, but for files
- Disconnect/Delete account buttons that modify the local storage/database entry
- A profile page that shows a user's 'scanned' URLs and files
